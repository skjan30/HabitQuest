# HabitQuest - Complete Development Guide

## Overview
HabitQuest is a gamified habit tracker that transforms daily routines into RPG adventures. Users create quests (habits), complete them to earn XP and gold, level up their hero character, and build streaks.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

### Step 1: Project Setup
```bash
npm create vite@latest habitquest -- --template react-ts
cd habitquest
npm install
npm add lucide-react@latest tailwindcss@latest autoprefixer@latest postcss@latest
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS
Update `tailwind.config.js` to include all source files and enable JIT compilation.

### Step 3: Create Type Definitions
Define TypeScript interfaces for:
- `Quest`: Represents a habit/task with rewards, streaks, and completion status
- `Hero`: Represents the user's character with level, XP, gold, and stats

### Step 4: Build Core Hooks
Create custom React hooks for state management:
- `useHero`: Manages character progression, XP gains, leveling up
- `useQuests`: Handles quest creation, completion, and persistence
- `useNotifications`: Manages browser notifications and reminders

### Step 5: Create UI Components
Build reusable components:
- `HeroCard`: Displays character stats, level, XP bar, streaks
- `QuestCard`: Shows individual quests with completion buttons
- `AddQuestModal`: Form for creating new quests
- `RewardNotification`: Animated popup for XP/gold rewards
- `NotificationBanner`: In-app reminders for uncompleted quests
- `NotificationSettings`: Toggle for browser notifications

### Step 6: Implement Game Mechanics
- XP calculation and leveling system
- Gold rewards and accumulation
- Streak tracking and persistence
- Quest completion animations
- Progress visualization

### Step 7: Add Notification System
- Browser notification permissions
- Smart reminder scheduling
- Visual notification banners
- Settings management

### Step 8: Polish and Animations
- Gradient backgrounds and RPG aesthetics
- Hover effects and micro-interactions
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Responsive design for all devices

- Local storage for data persistence
- Context-free architecture for simplicity

### Styling Approach
- Gradient backgrounds for depth and visual appeal
- Consistent spacing using 8px grid system
- Responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes
- Hover states and animations for interactivity

## Development Best Practices Used

1. **Component Separation**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all data structures
3. **Custom Hooks**: Business logic separated from UI components
